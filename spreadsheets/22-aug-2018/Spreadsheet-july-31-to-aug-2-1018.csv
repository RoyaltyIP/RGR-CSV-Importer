This charming home was completely renovated in 2010 and provides so many options for today and for the future. Leave the car at home, you are a short walk to Carson Graham and Larson Elementary and blocks from Lonsdale where you'll find public transport, shops, restaurants and recreation facilities. Downstairs could easily be a one or two-bedroom suite, depending on your needs (currently being used as hair salon, just needs a stove). The awesome (covered) deck off the back of the house is perfect for entertaining or watching the kids on the trampoline. Lots of parking for your cars/boat/RV/toys. Coach house potential too! Priced well below the BC Assessed value. Check out the MATTERPORT tour.","Age & lot size from Tax Record, Measurements by BC Floorplans - BUYER TO VERIFY.
