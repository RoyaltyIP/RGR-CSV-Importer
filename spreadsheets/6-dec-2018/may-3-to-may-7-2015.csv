This 50's split level on a huge 60 x 183 - R2 Lot is a great opportunity and not to be missed. Original oak hardwood floors and lots of potential, but needs some work and updating. The home backs onto Still Creek and is close to walking and hiking paths, as well as being within walking distance of Skytrain, Lougheed Mall and schools. Most of the value is in the land, but this 4 level split, could also be updated and has a separate lower entrance.","Offer if any 7pm May 5th","Greater Vancouver","For Sale",,,,,,,,,"5/5/2015","$850,000","$392.07","1.10","5/11/2015","2","3","R2","$773,800",,"8","18.3","2,168","60.00","0.25","Burnaby","$392.07","1.10","House/Single Family"
