A basement suite that had the same high level of finish as the main floor, because sometimes suites are meant for family. They also were very discriminating in their choice of lots, they wanted a large lot that was private, with plenty of room for rv parking as well as other assorted toys. They loved to entertain and so made sure that the back yard had a large patio as well as a large covered deck off the kitchen for BBQing. Now, it can be yours.","Lock box on front door.
