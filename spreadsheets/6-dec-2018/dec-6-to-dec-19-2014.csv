Let me show you this beautiful, sunny, six acre farm located in a wide valley with pastoral and distant ocean views. In 2013, the original 1918 vintage farmhouse was totally and tastefully renovated and modernized yet in keeping with the ambiance of yesteryear. Everything is new from the foundation to the roof...inside and outside. The rooms are spacious. Three sets of French doors access a large ground level deck from the living and dining rooms. The kitchen and bathrooms are well-appointed. An open stairway leads to 3 bedrooms and bathroom. On the main level is an office/studio/bedroom, a laundry room and the back door entry leads to a large mud-room. The pastures are fenced & cross-fenced. There are 3 wells.","The owner is a licensed Realtor with the REBGV.","Greater Vancouver","For Sale",,,,,,,,,"12/12/2014","$502,000","$265.33","0.82","12/15/2014","2","3","AG","$612,000",,"209",,"1,892","0.00","6.00","Gulf Islands","$265.33","0.82","House with Acreage"
