With 64th Ave and Highway 10 right there you can access many different areas of the lower mainland very easily!

That means you won't have to keep running up the stairs to use the bathroom as the issue in so many other townhomes. This will not last long as townhomes are the hottest investment right now and they have not slowed down at all!! Don't miss out, I promise you will regret it.","Very clean unit.
