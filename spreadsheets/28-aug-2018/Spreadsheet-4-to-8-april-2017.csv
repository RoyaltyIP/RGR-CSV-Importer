The property overlooks the golf course and also enjoys views of the local mountains. Inside the home the main living area has soaring vaulted ceilings with the main focal point being the wood-burning fireplace. Unfortunately old man winter got hold of this lovely home, froze a pipe and caused water damage. This impressive home is definitely worth repairing. If you think you have the means to do so, be sure to check this one out. I'm sure you'll see the potential.","Additional PID# 006-561-504","BC Northern","For Sale",,"4/4/2017","$275,000","$67.78","0.96","0.96","4/18/2017",,,,,"Freehold NonStrata","3",,,,,,"R2"
