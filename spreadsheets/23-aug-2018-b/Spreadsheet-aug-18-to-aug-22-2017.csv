Located in the central yet private Benchlands neighbourhood, the complex offers ski in, ski out access, a nearby stop on the free Whistler Village shuttle loop and a rooftop hot tub where one can watch the sun set over Rainbow and Sproat mountains. The interior draws on Pacific Northwest design, with natural flooring and distressed timber feature wall supported by minimalist millwork, and a gentle colour scheme inspired by riverstone and driftwood. This rare end unit is rich in natural light, with a recently installed, state-of-the-art Lutron Lighting system offering superior control of the indoor atmosphere.","For viewings please contact dani@wrec.com, suzi@wrec.com or call Dani 604-698-6977.","Greater Vancouver","For Sale",,"8/18/2017","$895,000","$1,160.83","1.00","1.00","9/6/2017",,,,"$499.50","Freehold Strata","1",,,,,,"LUC"
